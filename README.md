PLEASE DON'T ACTUALLY USE THIS TO CALCULATE YOUR TAX

# Chester Devs - Unit Testing basics
Simple example of unit testing an application that calculates annual tax in the UK. This was given as a demo at the Chester Devs junior code event.

## Summary

The point of this repository is to be used as a reference, sometimes its handy to have familiar code to remind you how to do something.

The main point of the talk, is to test during your development:

- Write a small bit of code (not even a full function)
- Write a test or two to check it works
- Write another small bit of code
- Write a test or two to check it works
- And so on

This method of Unit testing has the following benefits

- You find bugs sooner and without needing to run the application
- You know sooner if you have broken something you have working
- It drives you to writing more modular code (smaller classes and functions)
